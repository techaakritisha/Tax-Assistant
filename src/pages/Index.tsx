                <AccordionTrigger>What tax regime should I choose for FY 2024-25?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  For FY 2024-25, the new tax regime is the default option. It offers lower tax rates 
                  without deductions. However, you can still opt for the old regime if you have significant 
                  deductions under sections 80C, 80D, HRA, etc. Use our calculator to compare both regimes.

                <AccordionTrigger>What are the major tax-saving deductions available?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Under the old tax regime, major deductions include Section 80C (up to ₹1.5 lakhs), 
                  Section 80D (health insurance), HRA, home loan interest, and NPS contributions. 
                  The new tax regime doesn't allow most deductions but offers lower tax rates.

                <AccordionTrigger>How is my taxable income calculated?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Taxable income is calculated by subtracting eligible deductions from your gross income. 
                  This includes salary, rental income, capital gains, and business income. Our calculator 
                  helps you determine your exact taxable income based on your inputs.

                <AccordionTrigger>What is the due date for filing income tax returns?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  For salaried individuals and non-audit cases, the due date is typically July 31st 
                  following the financial year. For businesses requiring audit, it's October 31st. 
                  Late filing may attract penalties under section 234F.

                  Our calculator uses the latest tax slabs and rules for FY 2024-25. While it provides 
                  highly accurate estimates, the final tax liability may vary based on specific exemptions 
                  and deductions. For complex tax situations, consult a tax professional.
